# SwiftMiniProject

This repository is inspired by Allen Wang's [30DaysofSwift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift/blob/master/README.md) and Sam Lu's [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/). After visiting their project websites, I decided to create my own repository, and implement as many small mini projects as I can not only to practice my Swift programming skills, but also to share my knowledge. I will keep updating this repository as I come up with more ideas.
